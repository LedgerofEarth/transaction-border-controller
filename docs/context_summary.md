## Status
- TxIP-00 and TGP-00 draft specs defined.
- CoreProver escrow model outlined.
- TBC gateway Rust scaffolding complete.
- Next: implement message routing and proof validation.

## Short-Term Goals
1. Implement TGP message parsing and routing.
2. Integrate CoreProver receipt and escrow flow.
3. Create test harnesses for settlement paths.
4. Align with x402 session model.

## Long-Term Goals
- Multi-chain routing and Layer-9/10 policy integration.
- Carrier-grade deployment with telemetry and TDR.
- AI-agent interoperability.
